    "As a basketball enthusiast, I've always loved watching NBA games, keeping up with offseason moves, and arguing about \"best\" teams with my friends. One of the hobbies that I have picked up watching basketball is predicting the outcomes of games based on what players were on which teams. To be honest, I have never been too good in predicting because I tend to bias players / teams I like more. For example, every time the Warriors play, I predict them to win because in my opinion they are the best team in the NBA :) Jokes aside, I was curious to see how accurate a computer could be in predicting the outcome of NBA games, based on past player statistics and who was playing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will be looking into NBA data, ranging from past player statistics to outcome of previous games, in order to form a machine learning algorithim to predict outcome of games. I hypothesize that the machine will do a lot better in guessing the outcome of games then I do, because it probably will be less biased. Of course, I will be testing the fairness of the model after to confirm this."
